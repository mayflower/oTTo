# Kubernetes environment for frontend and backend

## Status

accepted

## Context

Kubernetes is in high demand in the market. Strategic orientation towards adopting this technology.

## Decision

Run the project on Kubernetes, which not only meets current technology requirements, but also provides
the team with the opportunity to build and expand knowledge on Kubernetes.

## Consequences

The project team must extensively familiarize themselves with Kubernetes.
As the project is open-source, we also want it to be deployable as Docker container.
